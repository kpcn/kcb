<!--
React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that **your UI was a function of your state**. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is _built_ upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.

Let's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.

**State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.** This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization. -->

## Glossary

Before we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:

- UI State State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).
- Server Cache State State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).
- Form State The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also [controlled & uncontrolled form state](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).
- URL State State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)
- State Machine An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green → yellow → red, but never green → red).
